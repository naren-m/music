## Key Concepts for Implementation

### From Chapter 1 (Svaragatadhyaya)

- **22 Shrutis**: Complete microtonal system
- **Nada Theory**: Sound production and perception
- **Svara Classification**: 7 shuddha + 12 vikrit = 19 total svaras
- **Grama Systems**: Primary scale structures
- **Murcchana**: Derivative scale patterns

### Frequency Relationships

Based on historical just intonation ratios documented in Sangita Ratnakara:

```
Sa  = 1/1     = 0 cents
Ri₁ = 16/15   = 112 cents (approx 90 in our implementation)
Ri₂ = 9/8     = 204 cents
Ga₂ = 6/5     = 316 cents
Ga₃ = 5/4     = 386 cents
Ma₁ = 4/3     = 498 cents
Ma₂ = 45/32   = 590 cents (approx 612 in our implementation)
Pa  = 3/2     = 702 cents
Dha₁= 8/5     = 814 cents (approx 792 in our implementation)
Dha₂= 5/3     = 884 cents (approx 906 in our implementation)
Ni₂ = 9/5     = 1018 cents
Ni₃ = 15/8    = 1088 cents
```
